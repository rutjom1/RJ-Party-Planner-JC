## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm, inviting coral that suggests festivity and energy, using hex #E08151.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated peach that provides a subtle, calming backdrop without detracting from content, using hex #F4F1F0.
- Accent color: A vibrant, rich crimson that offers a strong contrast for key actions and highlights, using hex #B7142F.
- Headline and body font: 'PT Sans' (humanist sans-serif), chosen for its modern appeal and legibility across various text sizes, offering a friendly yet professional feel.
- Utilize a consistent set of clean, vector-based icons that visually represent party elements, planning tasks, and communication features (e.g., calendar, invitation, chat bubbles, checklists).
- Implement a clean, organized, and intuitive layout with ample whitespace, making navigation and content consumption straightforward for event planning and guest interaction.
- Incorporate subtle, tasteful animations for transitions between sections, confirmation of actions (e.g., RSVP submission), and new message notifications in the chat, enhancing user engagement without being distracting.
